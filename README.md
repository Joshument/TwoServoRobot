# TwoServoRobot
School project for an Arduino
Pretty basic but I thought I'd put it up here,
and since I have to change my code a bit to utilize a proximity sensor, I thought it would be a good idea to practice how to use git as well

It's commented and I've been writing it as if it's public, so feel free to use it
